## Beautiful Java SDKs for APIs

This project is used for a talk on beautiful SDK Design

### Run the Demo

The example demonstrates using an SDK design based on the one Lez Hazlewood created for Stormpath.

The SDK interacts with the [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) API.

*NOTE*: This is NOT a complete SDK and is not suitable for production use

To run the demo, you need a Digital Ocean account and you need to create an API token.

Create the file: `~/.digitalocean/digitalocean.yaml` with the following:

```
digitalocean:
  client:
    token: <your digital ocean api token>
    orgUrl: https://api.digitalocean.com
```
